To run, open folder on Pycharm and make sure to have the python-chess library installed and pyqt5 to run the gui.
```py 
pip3 install python-chess
pip3 install pyqt5
``` 
Then, run either `test_chess.py` for a terminal output of the chess game or `gui_chess.py` for a UI version of chess. Note that the test cases I ran are in `test_chess.py` and must be commented out in order to be ran properly, based on which agents are to be used in the game.
